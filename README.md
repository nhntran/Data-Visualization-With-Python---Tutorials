# Python visualization tools - Tutorials

The most common Python visualization tools are Matplotlib and Seaborn. Besides, you can try to make simple plots using Pandas.
This tutorial repository includes:
1. Basic and advanced techniques with Matplotlib for displaying graphs, charts, colors, etc. ("Plotting with matplotlib - All you need to know.ipynb")
2. Using Matplotlib for image visualization ("Using matplotlib for displaying image.ipynb")
3. Visualization with Seaborn ("Plotting with seaborn  - All you need to know .ipynb")
4. Visualization with Pandas ("Plotting with pandas - All you need to know .ipynb") 

Data used for these tutorials is the "train.cvs" filr from Titanic dataset on Kaggle. You can download it at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv

The documents are still in the progress of completion. So please bear with me when I try to make them perfect.

Thank you and enjoy!
